Data Collection:

Obtain car data from multiple states in JSON format from CarDekho.
Data Conversion:

Use Pandas to convert the JSON file into a structured and meaningful DataFrame.
Data Cleaning:

Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, remove outliers, and standardize formats (e.g., date formatting, unit conversions).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze data distribution, feature importance, and correlations to understand key patterns.
Feature Engineering:

Create or transform features to improve model performance (e.g., extracting year from date, encoding categorical variables).
Skewness Correction:

Address any skewness in the data using transformations like log or Box-Cox to improve the distribution of features.
Model Preparation:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Scale the data if necessary (using StandardScaler).
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve the modelâ€™s performance using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Model Selection:

Train a Random Forest model for regression, which predicts car prices.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
Pickle the Model:
Save the trained Random Forest model using pickle for later use.
Streamlit Deployment:
Push the pickled model to a Streamlit app (app.py) where users can input car details and predict car prices.
Integrate the input columns such as 'bt', 'km', 'transmission', 'ownerNo', 'oem', 'Insurance Validity', 'Fuel Type', and 'Mileage'.
Run the App:
Deploy the Streamlit app to allow users to run predictions and get estimated car prices in real time.
